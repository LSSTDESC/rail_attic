The next stages (tentative project codenames subject to change) can be executed in any order or even simultaneously and may be broken into smaller pieces, each corresponding to an LSST-DESC Note.

* *(Name TBD)*: Extend the imperfect prior models and experimental design to accommodate template-fitting codes.

* *Off the RAILs*: Investigate the effects of erroneous spectroscopic redshifts (or uncertain narrow-band photo-zs) in a training set.

* *Third RAIL*: Investigate the effects of imperfect deblending on estimated photo-z posteriors.

* *RAIL gauge*: Investigate the impact of measurement errors (PSF, aperture photometry, flux calibration, etc.) on estimated photo-z posteriors.

* *DERAIL*: Propagate the impact of imperfect prior information to 3x2pt cosmological parameter constraints.

* *RAIL line*: Implement a more sophisticated true photo-z posterior model with SEDs and emission lines.
