The RAIL repository uses an issue-branch-review workflow.
When you identify something that should be done, `make an issue <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/issues/new>`_
for it.

To contribute, isolate `an issue <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/issues>`_ to work on and leave a comment on
the issue's discussion page to let others know you're working on it. Then, make a branch with a name of the
form `issue/#/brief-description` and do the work on the branch.

When you're ready to merge your branch into the `master` branch,
`make a pull request <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/compare>`_ and request that other collaborators review it.
Once the changes have been approved, you can merge and squash the pull request.
