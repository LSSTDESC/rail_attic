The RAIL repository uses an issue-branch-review workflow.
When you identify something that should be done, [make an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/issues/new) for it.
To contribute, isolate [an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/issues) to work on and leave a comment on the issue's discussion page to let others know you're working on it.
Then, make a branch with a name of the form `issue/#/brief-description` and do the work on the branch.
When you're ready to merge your branch into the `master` branch, [make a pull request](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/compare) and request that other collaborators review it.
Once the changes have been approved, you can merge and squash the pull request.
