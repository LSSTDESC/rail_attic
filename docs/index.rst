RAIL: Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers
===============================================

This repo is home to a series of LSST-DESC projects aiming to quantify the impact of imperfect prior information on probabilistic redshift estimation.
RAIL differs from [PZIncomplete](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/pz_incomplete) in that it is broken into stages, each corresponding to a manageable unit of infrastructure advancement, a specific question, and a potential publication opportunity.
By pursuing the piecemeal development of RAIL, we aim to achieve the broad goals of PZIncomplete.
