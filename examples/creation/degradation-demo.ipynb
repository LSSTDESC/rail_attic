    "# Using Creators abd Degraders to Generate Galaxy Samples with Errors and Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use a RAIL Creator to create galaxy samples, and how to use Degraders to add various errors and biases to the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the parlance of the Creation Module, \"degradation\" is any post-processing that occurs to the \"true\" sample generated by the Creator's Engine. This can include adding photometric errors, applying quality cuts, introducing systematic biases, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will first learn how to draw samples from a RAIL Creator object.\n",
    "Then we will demonstrate how to use the following RAIL Degraders:\n",
    "1. [**LSSTErrorModel**](#LSSTErrorModel), which adds photometric errors\n",
    "2. [**BandCut**](#BandCut), which applies cuts to the specified columns of the sample\n",
    "3. [**InvRedshiftIncompleteness**](#InvRedshiftIncompleteness), which introduces sample incompleteness\n",
    "4. [**LineConfusion**](#LineConfusion), which introduces spectroscopic errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, we will show how you can chain all these Degraders together to build a more complicated degrader.\n",
    "Hopefully, this will allow you to see how you can build your own degrader.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note on generating redshift posteriors*: regardless of what Degraders you apply, when you use a Creator to estimate posteriors, the posteriors will *always* be calculated with respect to the \"true\" distribution. This is the whole point of the Creation Module -- you can generate degraded samples for which we still have access to the *true* posteriors. For an example of how to calculate posteriors, see `posterior-demo.ipynb`."
