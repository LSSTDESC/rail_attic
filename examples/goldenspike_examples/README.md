This directory contains an example notebook showing a simplified version of the end-to-end functionality of RAIL.

- [goldenspike.ipynb](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/other-notebooks.html#goldenspike-an-example-of-an-end-to-end-analysis-using-rail) is a notebook that chains together the functionality of the creation, estimation, and evaluation modules.

If you want to see how to do this in a yaml, run the notebook once and the last few cells will create a pipeline file and config that can be reused.
