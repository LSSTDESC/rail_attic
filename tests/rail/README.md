# `rail` overview

There are three aspects to the RAIL approach, each defined by a minimal version that can be developed further as necessary.
The purpose of each piece of infrastructure is outlined below and described in a README in its own directory, where relevant code will ultimately live.

### creation

Code to forward-model mock data for testing redshift estimation codes, including physical systematics

### estimation

Code to automatically execute arbitrary redshift estimation codes

### evaluation

Code to assess the performance of redshift estimation codes
